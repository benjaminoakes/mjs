Minimal "Good Parts" JavaScript on the Rubinius VM

Motivation
----------

> The subset contained the best of the Good Parts. Even though it was a small language, it was very expressive and powerful. [...] There was nothing ugly or bad in the subset. All of that fell away.

Douglas Crockford, _The Good Parts_ (Chapter 10)

This is a Minimal JavaScript (mjs), meant to run on the Rubinius VM.

The goal is that if you stick to the "Good Parts" of JavaScript, you can run on Rubinius and elsewhere.
